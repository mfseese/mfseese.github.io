I am a PhD Candidate in [political science](https://polisci.ucsd.edu) and international affairs at the [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu).  My research lies at the interesection of comparative politics, international relations, and political economy.  My substantive work explores the political geography of civil war and state building in Africa.  My dissertation project uses geospatial data and methods to map and explain the spatial extent of governmental control in African states.  I am particularly interested in the _variation_ in govermental control throughout the continent, both within states and between them. I am also interested in the _effects_ of governmental control (or the lack thereof): How do patterns of welfare, security, and market activity differ in areas controlled by the center compared to areas in which the goverment either lacks a monopoly on violence, or exercises little authority. Methodologically, I am interested in geospatial methods, large _n_ sample surveys, and experimental designs.

During the PhD program, I spent several years as a research fellow with the [Institutions and Political Inequality](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality) group in the [Political Economy of Development](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development) cluster at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en) (Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f√ºr Sozialforschung).  Prior to the PhD, I completed a Master of International Affairs degree at the [School of Global Policy and Strategy](https://gps.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego, with emphases in international security and Latin American politics.  I also hold a B.A. in international relations, as well as a B.S. and M.A. in political science.

I teach a number of political science courses at UC San Diego, including:

* POLI 10: Introduction to American Politics
* POLI 11: Introduction to Comparative Politics
* POLI 127: Politics of Development
* POLI 120: Contention and Conflict in Africa

You can find the most recent syllabi for these courses, along with my teaching statement, elsewhere on this website.
